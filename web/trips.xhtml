    <p align="justify">1. <strong>Dumbéa</strong> is situated north of the
        capital Nouméa and is the 3rd largest town in New Caledonia. It is named
        after the “Doumbéa river” which services Noumea city on one hand, and
        irrigates a vast vegetable/fruit-growing plain on the other, before
        flowing into the sea. Dumbéa is also known for its unique primary tropical
        forest. This visit seeks to present the challenges faced by the Dumbéa
        river basin in terms of concurrently managing water resources, natural
        disaster risk, and environmental protection. Discussion will focus on: (1)
        water resource management in the water basin, (2) the 2005 bush fires,
        their impact and lessons learnt for enhanced fire management (including
        fire prevention and environmental restoration efforts), (3) challenges and
        threats to the area, and (4) efforts to protect this unique environment as
        a ‘provincial nature park.’ <br/>
        <br/>
        2. <strong>Yaté</strong>, located in the Southern tip of the main
        island, is home to New Caledonia’s most striking natural sites. It is also
        rich in nickel which is exploited through a large mining operation since
        2009. This visit will focus on the efforts of the municipality to balance
        industrial growth with the preservation of its environmental and cultural
        heritage. Focus areas: (1) disaster risk management (Yaté is prone to
        flooding, tsunami and industrial and chemical pollution, with impact on
        water resources), (2) water resource management, (3) land use planning,
        (4) environmental protection. <br/>
        <br/>
        3. Known for its surfing waves and in close proximity to the lagoon (a
        UNESCO world heritage site), <strong>Bourail</strong> is a rural town 160
        km north of the capital Nouméa. Since 2009, Bourail has a vibrant water
        management committee, bringing together water stakeholders and users to
        enhance the management of water resources. This visit will present: (1)
        the objectives of the committee, (2) its growth and structure, (3) key
        actions undertaken such as the protection of water catchment areas,
        inventory of resources, assessment of water needs and usage, and types and
        amounts of wastewater, (3) the particular challenges in terms of the
        proximity of the site to the lagoon, a UNESCO world heritage
        site. <br/>
        <br/>
        4. Water safety planning is being implemented throughout New Caledonia
        as an approach to reduce the risk of contamination of drinking water. An
        increasing numbers of municipalities, such as <strong>Bourail</strong>, are developing water safety plans and
        putting in place preventive and corrective measures to ensure the safety
        of drinking water (both in normal times and disaster situations). This
        risk management approach applied to water safety will be presented both
        from a national and a municipality perspective. Field visits will enable
        participants to witness measures taken on-the-ground and learn about
        management arrangements and solutions rooted in the New Caledonia
        context. </p>
